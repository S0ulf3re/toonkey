# Silence
"Silence" refers to one of the statuses an account may be in.

If an account is silenced, the visibility of their notes cannot be set to "Public" anymore. A silenced user will still be able to use the "Home", "Followers" and "Direct" visibility, so their posts will still be visible to their followers in addition to being able to directly visit their profile page, but their posts will not show up on the GTL (Federated timeline) or LTL (Local timeline) anymore.

Whether an account is silenced or not can be controlled by the moderators of a server.
