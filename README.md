# üöö Migrating from Misskey to Calckey

You need at least NodeJS v16.15.0 (v18.4.0 recommended!) and *exactly* üß∂ Yarn v3.2.2!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please don't use NodeJS v18.6.0, as it's known to cause problems.

## Inital setup
Consider adding the Calckey or main Misskey repo as your remote upstream so that you can pull changes from it if need be
```
git add remote upstream https://codeberg.org/thatonecalculator/calckey
```

## Install dependencies

```sh
# nvm install 18.4.0 && nvm alias default 18.4.0 && nvm use 18.4.0
corepack enable
yarn set version berry
```

## Get folder ready

```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/thatonecalculator/calckey.git
cd calckey/
# git checkout main # if you want only stable versions
cp ../misskey/.config/default.yml ./.config/default.yml # replace `../misskey/` with misskey path, replace `default.yml` with `docker.yml` if you use docker
# cp -r ../misskey/files . # if you don't use object storage
```

## üíÖ Customize

- To add custom CSS for all users, edit `./custom/instance.css`.
- To add static assets (such as images for the splash screen), place them in the `./custom/` directory. They'll then be avaliable on `https://yourinstance.tld/static-assets/filename.ext`.

## üöÄ Build and launch!

### `git pull` and run these steps to update Calckey in the future!

```sh
# git pull
yarn install # prepend `YARN_CHECKSUM_BEHAVIOR=update` if it doesn't work
NODE_ENV=production yarn run build && yarn run migrate
# Edit service to point to calckey folder and restart!
```

### üê≥ Docker

```sh
# git pull
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose stop && sudo docker-compose up -d
```
